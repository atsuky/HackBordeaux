## Inspiration

67% of the people that go to hospital it’s sad, so we try to let him feel better with our application

## What it does

We implemented a web app that tries to help the patients feel more comfortable when they are at the hospital
We do Sentiment Analysis on the patients in order to know how are they feeling, and try to improve their behavior
We geolocate the patient inside the hospital and we guide him if isn’t were he has to be
We have an admin panel for the hospital in order to prioritize them better

## How we built it

Node.js, sentiment analysis, geolocation and much more

## Challenges we ran into

Connecting everything together

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Finish something that we are able to present

## What's next for HealthHelper

Make it a native android/ios application
